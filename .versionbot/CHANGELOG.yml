    - subject: Remove Result type alias
      hash: 6c4e6cbf11b53064d8780935446425a266bbf0a4
      body: |
        The benefits of the alias do not outweight the drawbacks of having to
        use core::result::Result for std results

    - subject: Implement first version of the Worker
      hash: f81fc1d69efa071be3f6bf620cb59b252fac828e
      body: |
        This is a very basic version of the worker. It allows to seek a target
        searched via planning. This is very limited for now

        - it does not support parallelism in workflows
        - it does not support multi-threading in async calls (it requires a
          tokio::task::LocalSet to seek a new state).
        - it does not provide any mechanism to follow progress of the state

      hash: 2385d3133483ab46817ff654816c7d1708e14beb
      body: |
        The `with_arg` method in Context was additive, meaning repeated keys
        would be added independently of whether there was a value already. This
        caused a bug with the Path extractor. This update the PathArgs type with
        an `insert` method, that checks for a key before adding it.

      hash: 5e65156bce2d624413a101ad87503cbe969678f1
      body: |
        Refines the `FromSystem` trait, allowing implementors to define a type
        as non-scoped, indicating that it performs read-access to the global
        system state rather than a part of it indicated by the path linking the
        job on the domain.

        This also updates the handler and task definitions. An `is_scoped`
        function has been added to handler to indicate that the handler uses
        only scope extractors and is parallelizable.
