    - subject: Move state type conversion to planner
      hash: 4ed3ad1d12ae2e1eeee90444739540db9995edd0
      body: |
        The planner needs to be aware of the target type, so it can properly
        compare the updated state with the target on each iteration of the
        search.

        This transformation was previously done on the Worker

        This allow to have fields that exist in the worker state that
        are not connsidered for state comparison purposes. Some examples of this
        are dynamically created ids, timestamps, etc.

      body: |
        Remove the wait and cancel methods, the `seek_target` call is now async
        and returns when the target has been reached or an error (recoverable or
        not) happens. The search is interrupted if the worker is dropped.

        This also drops re-try behavior. Users can implement their own backoff
        and retry behavior.

    - subject: Move testing helper functions into Worker
      hash: c49796d0bb38daa272a3d5d81511c75e7dd45010
      body: >
        With the introduction of shared worker resources and the

        `Res`extractor, testing helpers like `test_task` (previously in the
        domain module) or

        `find_workflow` (previously in the planner module), no longer be

        trusted to succeed unless in the context of a `Worker` instance.


        This commit moves them under a `testing` module in worker that is

        exported if `debug_assertions` is set.

        Resources are shared/read-only data that may not be serializable, but
        are necessary for Task execution. Example of this are database
        connections, sockets, filesystem handlers, etc.

        Resources can be accessed with the `Res` extractor

    - subject: Add support for executing parallel workflows
      hash: 44e8df9483dda882a1d4fc40ee4c285071a0ed8e
      body: |
        Running DAGs now creates separate futures for graph branches that are
        joined later. This means that workflows with IO operations will run in
        parallel. Note that branches do not spawn new tokio tasks, so long
        running synchronous tasks (rather than I/O operations) may still result
        in inefficient execution of workflows.

        registers a tracing subscriber that emits `log` crate human readable
        records. The crate requires importing the `tracing_subscriber` and
        `log` crates.

          tokio::task::LocalSet to seek a new state).
        - it does not provide any mechanism to follow progress of the state

        The `with_arg` method in Context was additive, meaning repeated keys

        Refines the `FromSystem` trait, allowing implementors to define a type
        as non-scoped, indicating that it performs read-access to the global
        system state rather than a part of it indicated by the path linking the
        job on the domain.

        This also updates the handler and task definitions. An `is_scoped`
        function has been added to handler to indicate that the handler uses
        only scope extractors and is parallelizable.
