    - subject: Rename Path extractor to Args
      hash: 661ff15ea95cfae384cb045639b03d137c92853f
      body: |
        This is to be more consistent with the `with_arg` context/task method.

    - subject: Fix bug when adding args to Context
      hash: 2385d3133483ab46817ff654816c7d1708e14beb
      body: |
        The `with_arg` method in Context was additive, meaning repeated keys
        would be added independently of whether there was a value already. This
        caused a bug with the Path extractor. This update the PathArgs type with
        an `insert` method, that checks for a key before adding it.

      body: |
        The `System` extractor allow tasks to get read access to the global
        system state.

    - subject: Introduce the concept of scoped extractors
      hash: 5e65156bce2d624413a101ad87503cbe969678f1
      body: |
        Refines the `FromSystem` trait, allowing implementors to define a type
        as non-scoped, indicating that it performs read-access to the global
        system state rather than a part of it indicated by the path linking the
        job on the domain.

        This also updates the handler and task definitions. An `is_scoped`
        function has been added to handler to indicate that the handler uses
        only scope extractors and is parallelizable.
